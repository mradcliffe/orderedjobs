[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mradcliffe/orderedjobs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mradcliffe/orderedjobs)

This is a class to complete the [Ordered Jobs Kata](http://invalidcast.tumblr.com/post/52980617776/the-ordered-jobs-kata) as part of the ColumbusPHP Meetup.

The challenge is to take a "job structure", which is a multi-line string of "jobs", and output the jobs in dependency order.
